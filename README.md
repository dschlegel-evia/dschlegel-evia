## Who Am I? 🤔
I am a mysterious code ninja 🥷 who has mastered the art of:
- Breaking code at 2 AM 🕒
- Fixing bugs by just looking at them 👀
- Naming variables with extreme creativity like `data`, `stuff`, and `thingy` 🥇

## My Superpowers 💪
- **Git Commit Messages**: Writing commit messages that are more like cryptic puzzles. ("Fix issue" and "Oops" are my specialties)
- **Stack Overflow Scavenger**: I can find the exact error message in under 30 seconds ⏱️. Usually followed by copying and pasting the top-voted answer.
- **Infinite Loops**: I'm a master of creating loops that run forever, just because the computer deserves a little workout too! 🏋️‍♂️

## My Toolbox 🛠️
- **Languages**: Java, Xquery, JQuery, JavaScript, PHP and Gibberish
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, VueJS, React, and Procrastination.js
- **Databases**: Marklogic, MongoDB, SQL
- **Tools**: IntelliJ, VS Code, Jira, Git, and a large cup of coffee ☕ (the stronger, the better)

## My Coding Philosophy 🧘
- "Why write clean code today when you can refactor tomorrow?"
- "If it works, don't touch it. If it doesn't work... well, that's future me's problem."

## Fun Facts 🎉
- I once wrote a "Hello World" script in 10 different languages just because I was bored.
- I believe semicolons are optional, but chaos is mandatory.
- My spirit animal is a rubber duck because debugging is best done aloud.
